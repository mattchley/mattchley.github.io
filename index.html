      Matthew Atchley is currently in the process of changing his career. After working for Whole Foods Market as an
      Assistant Team Leader for 5 years it was time to make a change. He always enjoyed traveling from a young age and
      hopes that becoming an expert coder will allow him to take his work wherever he chooses.
      He is passionate about learning about as things big and small. He believes that any problem can be examined from
      multiple angles to determine what is the most effective course of action. But when he isn’t trying to absorb all
      the information around him, Matt enjoys playing guitar, cycling (although his bike needs some repair), analyzing
      media, a finely crafted stout, and working on his next big trip.
      Matthew believes that he will use all that this Coding Bootcamp has to offer and move to Dallas within the next
      year with his long time girlfriend. He will spend 2 years working on creating a better portfolio and gathering
      work experience in order to move to Europe, specifically Sweden. He fell in love with the country after his visit
      in December of 2018 and had to find a way to live where he can meet more moose and reindeer.
      Matthew is a dedicated individual who can tackle any complex task work related or life related.
